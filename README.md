# test2

Test2 is a modular testing lib for Clojure.

It has a ring-like [SPEC](SPEC.md), so that different parts can be
changed out for alternatives. For example, if you want a different
reporter function, you can write one or use another reporter lib that
conforms to this spec.

Coming from clojure.test? Midje? Speclj? [Read here](#benefits-over-other-libs) to see how test2 can help you.

## Install

Copy/paste as needed into your project.clj:

```clojure
[test2 "1.0.0"]              ;; in :dependencies
[lein-difftest "2.0.0"]      ;; in :plugins
```
