# test2

Test2 is a modular testing lib for Clojure.

The major feature is its [SPEC](SPEC.md) (like ring-clojure), which allows you to change out individual parts for alternatives, like the test-runner, test-reporter, and assertion functions, without having to switch to another testing lib.

## Rationale

The other day, I started a new project and wanted to write some tests. But I kept going back and forth between clojure.test, midje, speclj, and expectations (among others). Each one had some feature I really needed, but was lacking all the other features I needed.

This aims to solve that problem for anyone needing a Clojure test lib. You might want to swap out your runner, or your reporter, or your definer, or your asserters. But you don't have to change testing libs just to do it. You just add a lib to yor project, *that's all*.

The goal is that you can extend the lib from the outside to do what you want without having to switch to another lib and rewrite all your tests.


## Install

Copy/paste as needed into your project.clj:

```clojure
:dependencies [[test2 "1.0.0"]]
:aliases {"test2" ["run" "-m" "test2.run"]}
```

* [API Docs](http://evanescence.github.com/test2)

## Community

* #clojure on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) IRC

## Usage

There's plenty of ways to [Define Tests](../../wiki/Home#defining-tests) and [Make Assertions](../../wiki/Home#making-assertions). Choose whichever you prefer best.

Run them via Leiningen, which takes [some options](../../wiki/Home#command-line-options).

```bash
$ lein test2
```

The default runner and reporter are very plain, but test2 comes with some alternatives, such as a reporter that prints in terminal-formatted color, and a runner that runs test in random order.

## Notable Extensions

* [test2-rspec](#) - Provides definers and asserters similar to RSpec / Speclj.
* [test2-midje](#) - Provides similar functions to Midje's `facts`/`fact`.
* [test2-autorunner](#) - Watches your files and re-runs tests when something changes.
* [test2-async-runner](#) - Runs tests concurrently.
* [test2-difftest](#) - Reports tests using a diff-style format.

See the [Third Party Extensions](../../wiki/Home#third-party-extensions) section of the wiki for a comprehensive list.
