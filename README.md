# test2

Test2 is a modular testing lib for Clojure.

The major feature is its [SPEC](SPEC.md) (like ring-clojure), which allows you to change out individual parts for alternatives, like the test-runner, test-reporter, and assertion functions, without having to switch to another testing lib.

## Install

Copy/paste as needed into your project.clj:

```clojure
[test2 "1.0.0"]             ;; in dependencies
[lein-test2 "1.0.0"]        ;; in plugins
```

## Documentation

* [Wiki](https://github.com/evanescence/test2/wiki)
* [API Docs](http://evanescence.github.com/test2)

## Community

* #clojure on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) IRC

## Usage

Define some tests:

```clojure
(use 'test2.expect)
(use 'test2.def)

(defn ^:test user-creation
  "Creating users adds them to the list, but they're disabled by default." []
  (expect empty? (all-users))
  (create-user "bob")
  (expect = 1 (count (all-users)))
  (expect truthy? (:disabled (first (all-users)))))
```

Read more about [Defining Tests](../../wiki/Home#defining-tests).

Then run them:

```bash
$ lein test2
```

Or, in Clojure:

```clojure
(use 'test2.run)

(run-tests) ;; runs all in project
(run-tests :namespaces ['foobar.test.core 'foobar.test.extra])
(run-tests :matching :migration)
(run-tests :matching #(-> % :name name (.startsWith "users")))

;; read the API docs for more details
```

Read more about [Swapping out the Runner or Reporter](../../wiki/Home#swapping-out-the-runner-or-reporter).

You can also define [Test Suites](../../wiki/Home#test-suites), which act as filters to run only tests matching a given function.

## Notable Plugins

* [test2-rspec](#) - Provides definers and asserters similar to RSpec / Speclj.
* [test2-midje](#) - Provides similar functions to Midje's `facts`/`fact`.
* [test2-autorunner](#) - Watches your files and re-runs tests when something changes.
* [test2-async-runner](#) - Runs tests concurrently.
* [test2-difftest](#) - Reports tests using a diff-style format.

See the [Plugins](../../wiki/Home#plugins) section of the wiki for a comprehensive list.
