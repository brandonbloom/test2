# test2

This lib mostly just a SPEC (compojure-style) with a few helper functions and default implementations. The goal is that anyone can write new third-party peices that fit into this to do cool new things.

Coming from clojure.test? Midje? Speclj. [Read here](#coming-from-other-libs) to see how test2 can help you.

## Usage

### Defining tests

To define tests, add the `:test` key to a function's metadata. Tests can be defined anywhere. If they have a docstring, that will be used in the report. (Depending on the test-reporter you use, you may want to keep this short, like only one line).

```clojure
(defn ^:test some-test []
  ...)
```

There are some helper functions for defining tests. Look at `test2.transition/deftest` and `test2.transition/use-fixtures` if you're migrating from clojure.test.

**TODO:** perhaps add more helper functions in `test2.core` to define tests.

### Making assertions inside tests

There are some helper functions for assertions. Look at `test2.transition/is` and `test2.transition/are` if you're migrating from clojure.test.

**TODO:** Add more! Especially if coming from Speclj or Midje.

### Running tests

```bash
lein test2
```

Or if you want to run it from the REPL:

```clojure
(test2.core/run-tests) ;; runs all tests
(test2.core/run-ns-tests 'namespace1 'namespace2) ;; limit to namespaces
(test2.core/run-matching-tests f) ;; runs only tests whose metadata passes (f)
```

## Spec

Running tests is split into 5 distinct responsibilities:

* [Defining tests](#defining-tests)
* [Assertions](#assertions)
* [Finding tests](#finding-tests)
* [Running tests](#running-tests)
* [Reporting on tests](#reporting-on-tests)

### Defining tests

Any Clojure function in your project that has a truthy `:test` metadata key is a valid test. To eliminate ambiguity, we refer to these as test-fns in this document. Example:

If a test-fn has a docstring, that will be considered its "description" for the reporter.

### Assertions

While a test is being run, it has access to a variable `*test-results*`. It's a seq, and every assertion should conj a test-result onto it.

A test-result is a Clojure map with these keys and values:

* `:status` - either `:pass` `:fail` or `:error`
* `:description` - an optional string if the user provided one for this individual assertion
* `:failure-report` - a Map with the following keys:
  * `:result` - a plain Clojure value, the result of the assertion-function
  * `:fn` - a raw form of the function that was used in the test
  * `:args` - seq of the post-eval'd arg-values passed to :fn
  * `:raw-args` - seq of the pre-eval'd arg-forms passed to :fn

### Finding tests

There are some concrete helper functions for finding tests in your namespace.

* `test2.core/get-test-fns` - Return a seq of all test-fns in all this project's namespaces matching the given regex (loading them if necessary?), or all if no regex provided.
* `test2.core/run-test-fn` - Runs a single test-fn, wrapping `*test-results*` around it, and returning the test-results.
* `default-runner` - Just maps `get-test-fns` with `run-test-fn` and passes results to reporter.
* `default-randomized-runner` - Same as `default-runner` but runs tests in random order. Note: this does not affect the order they are reported in.

If you're running tests from in a REPL, you'd call `default-runner` as it is the highest-level entry-point.

TODO: figure out where the selector-fn fits into all this. I'm starting to think it needs to have a single stable high-level runner, that filters tests by sel-fn, finds the inner-runner, finds the report, and puts them all together. Seems legit? If you don't pass them, they'll be found out from your configs.

### Running tests

`run-all-tests` will run all tests, finds your reporter, and passes the results to it. Your reporter should do the rest.

### Reporting on tests


## Coming from other libs

Gotta do this part later.






Questions:

Where are all the places you can specify things?

- Runner can be specified by passing it to `run-tests`
- Runner can be specified by putting it in `project.clj`
