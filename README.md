# test2

Test2 is a modular testing lib for Clojure.

It has a ring-like [SPEC](SPEC.md), so that different parts can be
changed out for alternatives. For example, if you want a different
reporter function, you can write one or use another reporter lib that
conforms to this spec.

Coming from clojure.test? Midje? Speclj? [Read here](#benefits-over-other-libs) to see how test2 can help you.

## Install

Copy/paste as needed into your project.clj:

```clojure
[test2 "1.0.0"]              ;; in :dependencies
[lein-difftest "2.0.0"]      ;; in :plugins
```

## Usage

```clojure
(use 'test2.core)

(defn ^:test user-creation
  "Creating users adds them to the list, but they're disable by default." []
  (expect empty? (all-users))
  (create-user "bob")
  (expect = 1 (count (all-users)))
  (expect truthy? (:disabled (first (all-users)))))
```

```bash
$ lein test2
```

```clojure
(use 'test2.core)

(run-all-tests)
(run-ns-tests 'foo.test.core 'foo.test.other)
(run-matching-tests :migration)
```

### Benefits over other libs




### Swapping stuff out

Your `project.clj` file can have a `:test2` key to a map of options.

Currently it takes `:runner` and `:reporter` which are symbols pointing to functions which conform to the [SPEC](SPEC.md).

```clojure
:test2 {:runner test2.runner/randomized-runner}
```

### Test suites

The `:test2` map can also take a `:suites` key. Its value is a map of names to functions. The function is called with each test-function's metadata, and only matching tests are run.

`some_test.clj`:

```clojure
(defn ^:test ^:integration my-test [] ...)
```

`project.clj`:

```clojure
:test2 {:suites {:ci :integration}}
```

Then:

```bash
$ lein test2 :ci
```
