=== Test2 Spec (1.0)

Test2 finds tests, filters them, runs them, and reports on them, in that order. Filtering them is configurable. Runners and reporters can be swapped out for different ones.

During execution of a test-fn, the seq `*test-results*` is available, which every assertion should conj an assertion-result onto.





<!-- == Test Flow -->

<!-- 1. All test-fns are found and passed to `run-test-fns`. -->
<!-- 2. Each one is run and mapped into -->

<!-- 1. User chooses some or all tests to run. -->

<!-- 1. The user initiates running the tests somehow (lein, repl, whatever). -->
<!-- 2. All tests are searched, required, and possibly filtered. -->
<!-- 3. The ones allowed to run right now are passed to `run-test-fns`. -->
<!-- 4. This function lazily maps each test-fn into a test-result. -->
<!-- 5. It passes this lazy seq to the reporter, which then reports somehow. -->



== test-fn

Any Clojure function in your project that has a truthy `:test` metadata key is a test-fn. If it has a docstring, that will be considered its "description" for the reporter.

== assertion-result

An assertion-result is a Clojure map with these keys and values:

:status
  (Required, Keyword)
  :pass if the test passed
  :fail if the assertion failed
  :error *only* if there was an *unexpected* exception

:description
  (Optional, String)
  For the reporter to know what the assertion is testing

:error
  (Required when status is :error, Exception)
  The exception that unexpectedly occurred

:failure-report
  (Required when status is :fail, Map)
  Has the following keys:

    :result
    (Required, any type)
    The result of the assertion

    :fn
    (Required, raw form)
    The literal callable-form that was used in the assertion

    :args
    (Required, seq of any types)
    The args after they were evaluated in the assertion

    :raw-args
    (Required, seq of raw forms)
    The args before they were evaluated in the assertion

== test-result

A test-result is a Clojure map with these keys and values:

:results
  (Required, seq of assertion-results)
  Results of every assertion in the function.

:test
  (Required, Var)
  The test-fn's var.
